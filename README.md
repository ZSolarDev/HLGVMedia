## What is it?
The name explains it pretty well, this is a Video Library made specifically for hashlink.

## How do I use it?
Well I mean it isn't done so there isn't much to put here.

# HLGVMedia Insight
## How was it made?
This compiles ffmpeg along with some HashLink externs. Notice anything? This isn't just mp4 support, it has support for all file types that ffmpeg has support for. This is why it was called, "HashLink General Video Media" instead of, "HashLink MP4" or, "HashLink H264."

## What led me to make this?
It was actually really silly. I used to only know how to compile to cpp, and never compiled to any other target for ***2 YEARS.*** I only knew about neko and html, and never knew anything else even existed until recently. Last week I found out so many more compile targets existed, and my friend told me how HashLink compiles so fast. They also told me that it works on many more platforms aswell. I never got this glory with cpp, so naturally I tried it out. The game I tried it out on was a game I'm working on right now, and it has videos in it. I mever thought about how the cpp-only hxvlc was cpp only, so I got really disappointed when I found out I had no videos. I started looking for alternative video libraries, and got even more disappointed when I found out no one madr any. Thats why I decided I wouls make one myself, and that my first library will be this.

# Credits
ZSolarDev: Made the library externs
ACrazyTown(Anthony): Helped me a TON with the externs
FFMpeg: Without ffmpeg, I would have to use vlc, which I only have hxvlc to base my code off of. Not only that, but the source code layout doesn't make sense to me(If you compile to cpp, you should use hxvlc.)
Soywiz: made openfl-ffmpeg, I based my HashLink externs on these.
